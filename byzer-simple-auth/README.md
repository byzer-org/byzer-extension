## Usage

### Command way in Notebook

Add a resource which declare who can access or not allowed to accessï¼š

```shell
!simpleAuth resource add _ -type file -path "s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack" -denies allwefantasy;
```

The above command means that all users except `allwefantasy` are allowed to access the
resource `s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack`.

```shell
!simpleAuth resource add _ -type file -path "s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack" -allows allwefantasy;
```

The above command means that only `allwefantasy` is allowed to access the resource `s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack`.

You can also use yaml format to add a resource:

```shell
!simpleAuth resource add '''

apiVersion: auth.byzer.org/v1
kind: Auth
userView: []

resourceView:
  - metadata:
      resources:
        - name: "file"
          path: "s3a://bucket2/jack"
    rules:
      - rule:
          verbs:
            - "load"
          users:
            allows:
              - name: allwefantasy
                role: testRole
            denies:
              - name: jack
                role: testRole

''';
```

Once you add a resource, you can use the following command to reload the auth configuration:

```shell
!simpleAuth admin reload;
```

You can also use the following command to delete a resource:

```shell
!simpleAuth resource delete _ -type file -path "s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack" -allows allwefantasy;
```

Make sure that the resource parameters you want to delete is exactly the same as the resource you added.


You can also use the following command to query a resource:

```shell
!simpleAuth resource query _ -type file -path "s3a://bucket7/tmp/jack";
```

### Manual way of writing YAML Auth file

The auth configuration file is a YAML file, the following is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: auth.byzer.org/v1
kind: Auth
userView: [ ]
resourceView:
  - metadata:
      resources:
        - name: "mlsql_system"
          path: "__auth_admin__"
    rules:
      - rule:
          verbs:
            - "empty"
          users:
            allows:
              - name: allwefantasy
                role: testRole
  - metadata:
      resources:
        - name: "file"
          path: "s3a://bucket2/jack"
    rules:
      - rule:
          verbs:
            - "load"
          users:
            allows:
              - name: allwefantasy
                role: testRole
            denies:
              - name: jack
                role: testRole

  - metadata:
      resources:
        - name: "file"
          path: "s3a://bucket3/jack"
    rules:
      - rule:
          verbs:
            - "load"
          users:
            denies:
              - name: allwefantasy
                role: testRole
            allows: [ ]

```

Notice that resource `mlsql_system.__auth_admin__` is a special resource which is used to control who can operate auth
configuration,
in this example, `allwefantasy` is defined as the only user who can operate auth configuration.
